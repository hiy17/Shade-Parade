‚Ä¢Project Overview

This web application allows users to input color hex codes and sort them by lightness or hue using Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort. Designed for designers, artists, and developers, it helps organize and visualize color palettes for improved consistency and better design decisions.

‚Ä¢System Architecture

*Frontend (Web Interface) - The frontend is implemented using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling and layout. These technologies ensure a responsive and dynamic user experience across devices.


-User Interface (UI)
              Color Input: A text box for entering hex codes (e.g., #FF5733, #DAF7A6) with placeholder text for guidance.
              Palette Display: Visual color blocks with hex labels.
             
-Sorting Options
              Lightness: Sort from lightest to darkest.
              Hue: Arrange by color spectrum (e.g., red to purple).


‚Ä¢Applied Computer Science Concept

*Sorting Algorithms 
     they form the core functionality of the application by enabling the organization of color palettes based on lightness or hue. These algorithms‚Äî
Bubble Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort

‚Äîare crucial for achieving the application's goal of providing structured, visually appealing color arrangements for designers, artists, and developers.

‚Ä¢Correctness and Efficiency

The web application ensures correctness by accurately sorting color hex codes based on their lightness or hue. It implements sorting algorithms‚ÄîMerge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort‚Äîto guarantee the proper arrangement of colors according to the selected attribute. Input validation ensures that only correctly formatted hex codes are processed, preventing errors and producing reliable results. Additionally, the input limit is set to a maximum of 10 hex codes to ensure optimal performance and usability.
For efficiency, the application leverages Merge Sort and Quick Sort, both of which have a time complexity of O(nlog‚Å°n), making them well-suited for larger datasets. While Bubble Sort is less efficient with a time complexity of O(n^2), it is included as a simpler option for smaller datasets or educational purposes. By combining these algorithms, the application strikes a balance between accuracy, performance, and flexibility, allowing designers, artists, and developers to effectively organize and visualize their color palettes.
